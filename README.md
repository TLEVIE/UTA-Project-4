# UTA-Project-4
## Data Analysis Project 4: From Lyrics to Sound
Weâ€™re planning on using YAMNet neural network to turn lyrics into the correct song. When looking up the lyrics, the model should accurately guess the Song Title, Artist, etc.

## Questions to answer
* How accurately can we get our model run when given lyrics?
* Can it run accurately with incomplete lyrics?
* Can it run when given an Artist or Song Title?

## How we divided the work flow
* Cleaning the data
* Creating a neural network
* Testing the nn
* Create an AWS domain and connect front end.
